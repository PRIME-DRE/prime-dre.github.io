# PRIME-DRE supports the Oregon National Primate Research Center

The Oregon National Primate Center ([ONPRC](https://www.ohsu.edu/onprc)) is currently at risk due to an [active media campaign](https://www.pcrm.org/onprc) suggesting that 
the State of Oregon should pressure Oregon Health Sciences University (OHSU) into closing the primate center. As PRIME-DRE, we support the valuable work of the ONPRC and we will send the following letter of support to the Governor of Oregon. We ask you to co-sign this letter in support of the National Primate Centers in general, and ONPRC in particular.

<p><i>Dear Gov. Kotek and Oregon Officials,    
     
On behalf of the Primate Data and Resource Exchange (PRIME-DRE), an international collaborative initiative dedicated to advancing biomedical research through transparent sharing 
of primate research data and resources, we are writing in strong support of the Oregon National Primate Research Center (ONPRC). 
     
We represent a group of over 250 members from countries all across in North America, Europe, and Asia. Our mission is to support open neuroimaging (MRI) data sharing from monkeys, 
and the productive re-use of those data to reduce the numbers of animals needed in future studies. We emphasize the profound impact its closure would have on biomedical research, 
particularly in understanding early-life and lifespan health. 
     
The ONPRC occupies a critical and unique position in biomedical science and towards our mission of open data sharing. Its extensive primate cohorts and state-of-the-art research 
infrastructure provide unparalleled capacity for studies that are otherwise impossible. Nonhuman primate (NHP) models are indispensable for investigating complex biological and 
neurological conditions that profoundly affect human health, particularly those rooted in early-life development that manifest significantly later in life, including Alzheimer's, 
cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and mental health disorders.
      
The large numbers of monkeys available at ONPRC are essential for statistically powerful studies, ensuring reproducibility and reliability in scientific findings. At a time when 
scientific research faces mounting scrutiny regarding reproducibility, ONPRC's commitment to rigorous, transparent methodologies, high standards of animal care and welfare, and 
open data sharing, sets an international benchmark. PRIME-DRE has directly benefited from ONPRC’s dedication to open science principles, which enhance the refinement, reduction, 
and replacement (the 3Rs) in NHP research. Data sharing, methodological transparency, and collaborative science—cornerstones of ONPRC's approach—greatly reduce redundancy in primate 
research, ultimately lowering the overall number of animals needed for essential biomedical discoveries.
     
Moreover, ONPRC’s research significantly enhances our understanding of lifespan development, addressing diseases that impose enormous human and economic burdens. The knowledge 
derived from ONPRC’s research directly informs strategies to prevent, diagnose, and treat devastating conditions that disproportionately impact vulnerable populations. Without this 
unique resource, vital pathways to understanding complex disease etiologies will be severely compromised, delaying critical breakthroughs and increasing the reliance on less precise 
models, potentially slowing medical advances by decades.
     
Closing the ONPRC would not only cause immediate disruption to vital scientific endeavors and considerable harm to the skilled workforce dedicated to these efforts but also undermine 
the state of Oregon’s standing as a global leader in innovative biomedical research. We urge you to consider the far-reaching negative implications that closure would entail, not only 
on Oregon’s research community but on public health worldwide.
     
We strongly encourage you to reaffirm your support for ONPRC, recognizing its indispensable role in advancing medical knowledge and improving lives. PRIME-DRE remains committed to 
advocating for ethical, transparent, and scientifically rigorous NHP research as conducted by ONPRC and would welcome any opportunity to discuss this further.
     
The PRIME-DRE Team,    
& the undersigned individuals </i></p>
